# GDP map interactive

Your task is to create an interactive containing a map and accompanying
table using the provided GDP.csv data.

You should spend around two hours on the task. We are not looking for a
"perfect" solution, instead we want to see how you approach the problem
and what you would do to improve or change it given more time.

Tasks:
* convert CSV into JSON
* geo-locate countries
* add map containing country marker pins
* add click and hover events to pins showing that country's GDP
* add a table of country names and GDPs, eg.

    +----------------------------+
    |  Country name |     GDP    |
    +---------------+------------+
    | United States | 16,800,000 |
    |     ...       |     ...    |
    |     ...       |     ...    |
    +----------------------------+

Use whatever tools, additional data, libraries or frameworks you wish.

Good luck.
